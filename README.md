# Graphics Programming
This repo contains some challenges for the Graphics Programming subject of the MsC Videogames Programming of UOC (Open University of Catalonia). Challenges are organized in folder and include the solutions. The are intended to be used as tutorials for learning graphics programming.

Some of those challenges are based on raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library to learn videogames programming.

**Features:**
 - Basic screen management
 - Basic shapes drawing (circle, rectangle)
 - Collision detection and resolution
 - Textures loading and drawing
