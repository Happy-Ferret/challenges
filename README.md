# Graphics Programming
This repo contains some challenges for the Graphics Programming subject of the MSc in Videogames Design and Development of UOC (Open University of Catalonia). Challenges are organized in folders and include the solutions. They are intended to be used as tutorials to learn graphics programming for videogames development.

Some of those challenges are based on [raylib](http://www.raylib.com/), a simple and easy-to-use library to learn videogames programming.

## Challenge 01. Blocks game
----------------------------

Implement a blocks game using [raylib](http://www.raylib.com/) library.

**Learning outcomes:**
 - Videogame structure: game life cycle
 - Graphic device and inputs management
 - Basic shapes drawing (circle, rectangle)
 - Collision detection and resolution
 - Textures loading and drawing
 - Sounds loading and playing
 - Basic screens management

## Challenge 02. Dungeon 2D game

Implement a tile-based dungeon 2D game using raylib [rlgl](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/develop/src/rlgl.c) low-level library module.

**Learning outcomes:**
 - Window creation and management (GLFW3)
 - Keyboard and mouse inputs management (GLFW3)
 - Image files loading (RAM and VRAM) and drawing
 - Vertex buffers management (immediate-mode) to draw basic shapes
 - TODO.

## Challenge 03. Maze 3D game

Implement a cubes-based maze 3D game using [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) graphics library.

**Learning outcomes:**
 - Window creation and management (GLFW3)
 - Keyboard and mouse inputs management (GLFW3)
 - Context creation (OpenGL 3.3) and extensions loading (GLAD)
 - Image files loading (RAM and VRAM) and drawing
 - Vertex buffers management (VBO) to 3d meshes
 - Models loading, transform and drawing
 - TODO.
